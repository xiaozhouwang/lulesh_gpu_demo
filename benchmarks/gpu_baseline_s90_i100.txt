Running problem size 90^3 per domain until completion
Num processors: 1
Num threads (hardcoded): 64
Total number of elements: 729000

To run other sizes, use -s <integer>.
To run a fixed number of iterations, use -i <integer>.
To run a more or less balanced region set, use -b <integer>.
To change the relative costs of regions, use -c <integer>.
To print out progress, use -p
To write an output file for VisIt, use -v
To only execute the first iteration, use -z (used when profiling: nvprof --metrics all)
